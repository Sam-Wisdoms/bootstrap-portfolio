About Me
Hello and welcome to my portfolio page. I am Sam-Wisdoms Amenyenu. I am currently enrolled in a 16-week Front-End Web Developer Boot Camp with edX in the United Kingdom.

My journey till this stage has been an interesting one. I have always wanted to contribute to technical problem solving that can bring about lasting solution but fact remains that life can sometimes place certain limitations on you. As a result of my interest to contribute to problem solving in society, I got heavily involved in community development initiatives through Non-Governmental Organizations as far back 2007. My background in Business Administration and some background in accounting are great transferrable skills I exhibit in any role. Also, my experience working in cross-cultural teams over the years have helped me to develop great adaptable talent with rich experience dealing with diversity. The technologies I have used to build this portfolio are HTML, CSS and Bootstrap 5.3. Other technical skills I will learn in the Bootcamp include UX/UI Design, JavaScript, API, React, Node.js, ES6, React etc. Projects I am currently working on which will soon be deployed are for trades tracking and accountability tracking system, website for my NGO, Save the Future Ghana and Designed templates page with available codes on request. Thank you for vising my portfolio page. Please feel free to contact me and letâ€™s discuss about how bringing my skills on board your team will support to deliver great value. Best regards, Sam-Wisdoms Amenyenu.
